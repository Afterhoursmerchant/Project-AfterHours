Xbox series X 
Heavy weight Title champion 
Breakdown





A).  Pros:



Most powerful console ever made by about  11.5%!
That almost makes it a no brainer... But...



B).   Cons:

( More people want PS5,
strangly I'm not sure why ,
but honestly I want a PS5 more also
So there is probably smaller community
of people who play Xbox now 
Maybe there's just something 
about the PlayStation 5 
that has everyone preferring
it over the more powerful XBOX. 
I think the PS5 just feels more futuristic,
the interface ,...
the menu ,...
powering on the console
has just more of a futuristic
Feel and never before seen
compared to XBOX which still has the 
Same menu and login Artwork as it did
10 years ago,
But either way go with your heart.




In the end the People have chosen 
The slightly less proforming 
Playstation5 
And if you can 
find the digital edition at Retail
399$ then it's clearly 
the winner in my eyes.
